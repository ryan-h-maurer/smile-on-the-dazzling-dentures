# Data Questions  
For this project you are tasked with using this data to determine the effectiveness of Smile On. Use the data provided to answer these questions:
1. Who has Smile On been serving (number of patients, age, gender, etc.)?
2. Explore the impact of the Smile On program and the outcomes that are produced for clients. Are clients seeing improvement through the Smile On program? 
3. Is there any correlation between procedures given and improved outcomes?  

Beyond the questions outlined above, you are encouraged to continue to explore the data to understand the effectiveness of the Smile On program and to try and see how different factors can impact the clinical results (eg. how do transportation options for clinics affect outcomes?).

Information about patients is gathered during different interactions (initial visit, checkups, etc.). The data you have been given include records spanning from May of 2018 through September of 2021. There is also a data dictionary that contains some useful information about the different columns.
